# Pizza_Shop-Application
A Pizza Shop application lets users browse pizzas, add them to a cart, and place orders. Built with ReactJS and Redux for efficient state management on the frontend, the backend uses ExpressJS to handle API requests and process orders, while MySQL manages the database, ensuring smooth interaction between the system components.
